## Stefan Fjällemark
**Programming since 1973, the last 25 years in Microsoft environment. 
I develop software for customers and for my own pleasure.**

**I have a background as professional software developer of applications and databases for the public transportation business, 
working for one of the largest Scandinavian software houses in this field. 
I retired in 2018 and since then, I worked part time as a freelancing software consulant, 
and otherwise focused on software for the module model railway community.**

### 50+ Years of Programming
Starting out back in school 1973 using a smaller PDP/8 computerand TTY-terminal with punchtape, 
my first programs where train timetable simulation and a dating program.
My proffessional coding started 1982 writing a timetable type setting program using a WANG computer and Basic, with transfer to the printing house.
Later, I wrote more programs and databases for public transport in Pascal on Prime and VAX computers.
From late 90's, I started with Microsoft Interdev, Visual Basic and SQL Server. A few years later it was .NET and Visual Studio, which it still is.
I have worked with software and databases for public transportation, so transport operation i know.
