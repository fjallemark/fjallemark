## Stefan Fjällemark
**Programming since 1973, the last 25 years in Microsoft environment. 
I develop software for customers and for my own pleasure.**

**I have a background as professional software developer of applications and databases for the public transportation business, 
working for one of the largest Scandinavian software houses in this field. 
I retired in 2018 and since then, I worked part time as a freelancing software consulant, 
and otherwise focused on software for the module model railway community.**

### 50+ Years of Programming
Starting out back in school 1973 using a smaller PDP/8 computerand TTY-terminal with punchtape, 
my first programs where train timetable simulation and a dating program.
My proffessional coding started 1982 writing a timetable type setting program using a WANG computer and Basic, with transfer to the printing house.
Later, I wrote more programs and databases for public transport in Pascal on Prime and VAX computers.
From late 90's, I started with Microsoft Interdev, Visual Basic and SQL Server. A few years later it was .NET and Visual Studio, which it still is.

### My Specialist Areas
- Developing in .NET and specifically Blazor - a web framework for .NET.
- Design and implementation of SQL databases, primarily using raw SQL on *SQL Server* and tools like *Entity Framework* and *Dapper*.
- Test driven programming in C#.
- Migration of systems from *.NET Framework* to *.NET 8.0* and later.
- Software for real time monitoring of transportation.
- Software for planning and controlling model railway trains at module meetings.
### Current project
- Since 2016, I have developing a [prototype for timetable planning](https://github.com/fjallemark/TimetablePlanningApp) that has been used for planning operations at several module meetings.
- Since 2019, developing a model railway fast clock as open source, see [Clock](https://fastclock.azurewebsites.net/) in Azure. There is also a project for controlling [analogue/FREMO RUT clocks](https://github.com/tellurianinteractive/Tellurian.Trains.ClockPulseService).
- Since 2020, developing a model railway module and meeting management system as open source, see [ModuleRegistry](https://moduleregistry.azurewebsites.net/).
- Since 2021, developing an app to create and print loco- and wagon cards for model railway operation, see [Wagon Card App](https://wagoncardapp.azurewebsites.net/).
- Since 2022, developing a [LocoNet© monitor and wiThrottle server application](https://github.com/tellurianinteractive/Tellurian.Trains.LocoNetMonitor).
- Since 2024, developing a standalone timetable planning app (it will be open source when the first usable release i ready).
### Interested in
- Developing open source.
- Learning and improving my development skills.
- Model railways, especially operation at module meetings, see [FREMO](https://www.fremo-net.eu/).
